# SDK Design Document

This document outlines the design and architecture of the Lord of the Rings SDK (LotrSDK), focusing on simplicity, extensibility, and performance.

## Overview

The Lord of the Rings SDK simplifies interaction with the Lord of the Rings API, providing features for fetching movies and quotes with filtering and pagination.

## Design Goals

1. **Simplicity**: An intuitive and easy-to-use interface for developers.
2. **Extensibility**: Easily add support for new API endpoints and features.
3. **Performance**: Efficient handling of HTTP requests with retry mechanisms for reliability.

## Architecture

The SDK uses a modular architecture with the following core components:

### Core Components

1. **Client**:
   - Manages HTTP connections using Faraday.
   - Implements a retry mechanism with `faraday-retry` to handle network issues.
   - Centralizes response parsing for consistency.

2. **Services**:
   - **MovieService**: Handles movie-related API operations, including fetching all movies, movie details, and quotes for a movie.
   - **QuoteService**: Manages quote-related API requests, such as fetching all quotes or a specific quote.

3. **Configuration**:
   - Manages environment variables, including the API key, using `dotenv`.
   - Provides easy configuration and setup for the SDK.

4. **Logging**:
   - Basic logging is implemented for monitoring API requests and tracking issues.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **HTTP Client - Faraday**:
   - Chosen for its flexibility and middleware support, making it ideal for handling API requests and retries.

2. **Environment Variables - dotenv**:
   - Simplifies secure management of sensitive information, like API keys.

3. **Retry Mechanism**:
   - Utilizes `faraday-retry` to improve network reliability by automatically retrying failed requests.

4. **Modular Service Design**:
   - Organizes API interactions into service classes, promoting maintainability and ease of extension.

## Usage Flow

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The SDK is initialized with the API version, and service instances are created.
2. **API Requests**: 
   - Service methods are called to perform operations, like fetching movies or quotes.
3. **Response Handling**: 
   - Responses are parsed and returned as structured data.

## Example Workflow

### Fetching Movies
1. Initialize the SDK and call `movie_service.all` with pagination and filtering options.
2. The `MovieService` uses the `Client` to make an API request and return the parsed response.

### Fetching Quotes
1. Use `quote_service.all` to get quotes with optional filters and pagination.
2. The `QuoteService` handles the API request and provides the structured data.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Rate Limit Handling**: Implement logic to manage API rate limits effectively.
2. **Caching**: Reduce API calls by caching frequently requested data.
3. **Support for More Endpoints**: Expand the SDK to cover additional API features.
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Add more detailed and configurable logging.

## Conclusion

The Lord of the Rings SDK provides a streamlined way to interact with the API, emphasizing ease of use, performance, and scalability. The modular architecture ensures maintainability and flexibility, making it a valuable tool for developers.
