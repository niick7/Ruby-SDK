1. The Sorting work incorrectly then I didn't apply to the SDK yet.
Details:
 + https://the-one-api.dev/v2/quote?sort=name:asc : won't work
 + https://the-one-api.dev/v2/character?sort=name:asc : work correctly

2. Filtering does not work with the /movie/{id}/quote.
Details: https://the-one-api.dev/v2/movie/5cd95395de30eff6ebccde5d/quote?character=a return all records.
